The primary motivation of the design is to combine audioception with ophthalmoception to achieve a en\kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 tertainment effect. With delicate fabrication, the fancy design can be applied to a variety of apparel and decoration, at the same it provides the possibility for people to explore their own style.\

The project is dealing with analog input, the objective is to turn it into a digital signal to control the on/off of each LED. To accomplish that, the seven frequencies are peak detected and multiplexed to provide a DC representation of the amplitude of each band. During the process, a standard analog signal is transformed into frequency domain. The intermediate function is a continuous power density spectrum. To develop spectral leakage at peak frequencies, a window function is convoluted with frequency. In this case, the window function is a Gaussian function. In this way, the amplitude of seven frequencies are filtered and selected.}
